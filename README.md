# DAD
The Dynamic assessment dashboard (DAD) is a software meant for teacher to let students take control over their learning (pace, tasks).

The student interface can be tested on [meetdad.ch/demo](https://meetdad.ch/demo).   
The admin interface still needs some development before inital release.
